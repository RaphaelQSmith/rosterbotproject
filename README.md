# How we start to build 
After we had gathered some useful resources for creating the slack bot , we started to build it with using a testing bot to test it how it works, then we started to implement it into our main Slack's Roster Bot.

# Phases for building the bot

* Phase one 
- We have created a Slack's app (RosterBot) inside the Slack platform then added it into a workspace ,then created a bot integration to   integrate with our app.
- In order to activate the bot, we have installed all the packages that we need especially slackbot package, then we have been using the   private unique token from the bot integration and store it inside our code therefore we'll be be able to invoke the bot once we run     our code.
- Before we run it , we have added the Rosterbot app and the bot that to intergrate with it inside the same channel.
